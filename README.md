<h1>Pathfinding Algorithms</h1>

Hello there! This a package based on Javascript implementations of pathfinding algorithms we made as a part of our college project.<br/>

This can be used with any web application that requires any kind of maze solving or pathfinding in general, we've introduced DFS, BFS, Dijkstra and A* algorithms in the first publish.<br/>

<h2>How to use?</h2>
<div>Step 1: Run <code>npm install pathfinding-algorithms</code> in the root directory.</div>
<div>Step 2: Import algorithms and use. That's it. See use cases.</div>

<h2>Next steps</h2>
<div>Import classes <code>import {dfs, bfs, astar, dijkstra} from 'pathfinding-algorithms'</div>
<h1>More coming soon...</h1>
